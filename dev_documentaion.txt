This file document how I approach this assesment in order to complete it.

- find out which api to use in pokemon api documentation
- ai prompt : how do we properly fetch list of pokemons, + their details from its URL properly (image, type, height, wight) parallelly? https:loop
{"name":"caterpie","image":"https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/PokeAPI\/sprites\/master\/sprites\/pokemon\/other\/official-artwork\/10.png","types":["bug"],"height":3,"weight":29}
is it okay that our image url \/?  json encode settings
- handle cors error?
'paths' => ['api/*', 'sanctum/csrf-cookie'],
    'allowed_methods' => ['*'],
    
    // Allow your Next.js frontend here
    'allowed_origins' => ['http://localhost:3000'], 

    'allowed_origins_patterns' => [],
    'allowed_headers' => ['*'],
    'exposed_headers' => [],
    'max_age' => 0,
    'supports_credentials' => false,

    what cai i add to improve my backend
    - Input validation: keep controller clean from validation logic
    - caching : data rarely change. watch out api call.
