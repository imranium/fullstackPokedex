This file document how I approach this assesment in order to complete it. (improved by gemini)

APPROACH & IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

1. API STRATEGY
   - The Requirement: Show a list of Pokemon with images, types, height, and weight.
   - The Problem: PokeAPI separates data. The "List" endpoint only gives names + URLs.
   - The Solution: 
     1. Fetch the list of 20 Pokemon (Page 1).
     2. Loop through the results to fetch details for each one.
     3. CRITICAL: Used Laravel's `Http::pool` to fetch these 20 detail requests in parallel. 
     Without this, the page load was taking ~10 seconds. With pool, it's under 1 second.

2. DATA FORMATTING
   - Image Source: The requirement asked for high-quality images. I used the 
     `sprites.other.official-artwork.front_default` path from the API response.
   - JSON Slashes: Noticed the API returns URLs with escaped slashes (e.g., "https:\/\/"). 
     Verified this is standard JSON encoding and the Next.js frontend decodes it automatically.

3. BACKEND IMPROVEMENTS (Extra Credit)
   - Input Validation: Created a dedicated `GetPokemonRequest` class. 
     This keeps the Controller clean and ensures `page` and `limit` are always integers.
   - Caching: Pokemon data doesn't change often. 
     Wrapped the API calls in `Cache::remember` (1 hour duration). 
     This prevents hitting the external PokeAPI rate limits and makes the app instant for repeat visitors.

54 FRONTEND SEARCH
   - PokeAPI doesn't support partial string search (e.g. "Pika").
   - Implemented Search on the backend:
     If a search term exists, I fetch the full list of names, filter them in PHP, 
     and then paginate the results manually before sending them to the frontend.
